# Student_District_Analysis

Motivation: 


The team is tasked with wrangling the standardized test data from 14 Charter and District schools with a student count that ranges from 400 â€“ 5000. As the chief data analyst on this assignment I was tasked with data wrangling and changing the layout and structure of the information by sorting, grouping, and merging the data set so that we can identify trends, patterns, correlations so that the information can be presented to the school board when they are considering their budget and other priorities. 
For the purpose of the challenge the focus was on Thomas High School trends. The standardized test scores of all grades 9-12. Some of the metrics included Average math and reading scores. As well as passing math and reading scores for each grade.

Purpose: 

Before wrangling through the data, and merging data sets we had to take a deeper look at what information would be useful to the school board, schools policy makers, and student scores. The obvious correlation being the budget each school has and how that correlates to the student count. 

Analysis & Challenges:

The new data shows that Thomas High School

In order to add to the correlation of budget to passing test score it would have been useful to have information on each school testing preparation data.
